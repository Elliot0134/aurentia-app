I want an Intégration page for both parts (organisation and individual). The intégrations in the organisation side is made for the org. Which means the intégrations made are solely for the organisation (mentors, staff and owner). The individual side intégrations are made for the individual user only. For the UI/UX, you can take the one in the /individual/profile intégrations tab as reference. The organisation side intégrations page should have the same layout and design but should be able to fit with the organisation's white label branding if its turned on (colours, logo, etc). Make sure to include sections for API keys, connected apps, and webhooks in both parts. The organisation side should also have a section for managing team integrations. Please provide the code for both pages including any necessary components and styles. All the components should follow the design system used in the rest of the application. And they should all be responsive and accessible.
