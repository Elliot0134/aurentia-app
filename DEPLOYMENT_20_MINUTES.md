## 🚀 3 STEPS TO DEPLOY

### STEP 1: Database (10 minutes)

**Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:**

```sql
-- File: db_migrations/20251004_add_organisation_extended_fields.sql
-- Copy entire file content and run it

-- Then update existing projects:
UPDATE project_summary
SET validation_status = 'validated',
    linked_to_organization = (organization_id IS NOT NULL)
WHERE validation_status IS NULL;
```

**Verify it worked:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM project_summary WHERE validation_status IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM project_mentors LIMIT 1;
```

✅ If both queries return data → Success!

---

### STEP 2: Test User Flow (5 minutes)

1. **Login as a member** with existing projects
2. **Go to:** `/individual/my-organisation`
3. **Look for:** "Lier un projet à l'organisation" card in sidebar
4. **Select** a project from dropdown
5. **Click** "Soumettre pour validation"
6. **Confirm** in dialog

**Expected:**
- ✅ Success toast appears
- ✅ Page refreshes
- ✅ Project now has status "En attente"

---

### STEP 3: Test Staff Management (5 minutes)

1. **Login as staff/admin** (user_role = 'organisation' or 'staff')
2. **Go to:** `/organisation/{your-org-id}/projets`
3. **Click tab:** "Gestion & Validation"
4. **You see:** Table of all organization projects

**Try these actions:**
- ✅ Filter by status dropdown
- ✅ Search by project name
- ✅ Click "Changer statut" → Select "Validé"
- ✅ Click "Assigner mentor" on validated project

---

## 🔍 VERIFY IT WORKS

### SQL Verification:
```sql
-- Applied projects should have these values:
SELECT 
  nom_projet,
  validation_status,      -- Should be 'pending'
  linked_to_organization, -- Should be true
  organization_id         -- Should have org ID
FROM project_summary
WHERE validation_status = 'pending';
```

### UI Verification:
- [ ] ApplyProject card shows in MyOrganization
- [ ] Staff tab shows in OrganisationProjets
- [ ] Status badges display with colors
- [ ] Filters and search work
- [ ] Dialogs open/close
- [ ] Toast notifications appear

| Status | Color | Icon |
|--------|-------|------|

| Terminé | 🟣 Purple | ✅ |
| Rejeté | 🔴 Red | ❌ |

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Column validation_status does not exist"
→ **Run Step 1 database migration**

### "Table project_mentors does not exist"  
→ **Run Step 1 database migration**

### ApplyProject card not showing
→ **Check:** User has projects AND user has organization

### Can't assign mentor
→ **Check:** Project status is "Validé" (green), not "En attente" (yellow)

### Staff management tab not showing
→ **Check:** User role is 'organisation' or 'staff'

---
