- [x] VISUAL_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md - Visual explanation
- [x] fix_organization_setup_pending.sql - Database repair script
- [x] This checklist

## Database Migration (CRITICAL)

### Step 1: Backup Current State
```sql
-- Backup profiles table (organization users only)
CREATE TABLE backup_profiles_org_fix AS
SELECT * FROM profiles
WHERE user_role IN ('organisation', 'staff');

-- Verify backup
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM backup_profiles_org_fix;
```

### Step 2: Run the Fix Script
```sql
-- Run the entire fix_organization_setup_pending.sql script
-- This will:
-- 1. Show BEFORE state
-- 2. Fix inconsistent data
-- 3. Show AFTER state
-- 4. Verify fix worked
```

### Step 3: Verify Database State
```sql
-- Should return 0 rows (no broken profiles)
SELECT COUNT(*) as broken_profiles
FROM profiles p
INNER JOIN user_organizations uo ON p.id = uo.user_id AND uo.status = 'active'
WHERE p.organization_setup_pending = true;
```

**Expected Result:** `broken_profiles = 0` ✅

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Local Testing
- [ ] Clear browser cache/localStorage
- [ ] Test login as organization user
- [ ] Navigate to `/organisation/:id/dashboard`
- [ ] Verify: No redirect loop
- [ ] Verify: Dashboard loads properly
- [ ] Check console: No errors
- [ ] Test navigation between org pages
- [ ] Test logout/login cycle

### 2. Staging Environment (if available)
- [ ] Deploy code changes to staging
- [ ] Run database fix script on staging DB
- [ ] Test all scenarios from TESTING_PLAN_REDIRECT_FIX.md
- [ ] Verify loading spinners appear correctly
- [ ] Test with different user roles
- [ ] Monitor staging logs for issues

### 3. Production Deployment
- [ ] Create database backup
- [ ] Deploy code to production
- [ ] Run database fix script on production
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Test with a test account
- [ ] Verify no errors in production logs
- [ ] Check user reports/feedback

---

## Testing Scenarios Checklist

### Scenario 1: Existing Organization User (Main Fix)
- [ ] Login as user with role 'organisation' or 'staff'
- [ ] Navigate to `/organisation/:id/dashboard`
- [ ] **Expected:** Dashboard loads without redirects ✅
- [ ] **Expected:** See brief loading spinner
- [ ] **Expected:** No console errors
- [ ] Navigate to other org pages (members, events)
- [ ] **Expected:** All navigation works smoothly

### Scenario 2: New Organization Setup
- [ ] Login as individual user
- [ ] Navigate to `/setup-organization`
- [ ] Fill and submit organization form
- [ ] **Expected:** Redirects to `/organisation/:id/dashboard`
- [ ] Logout and login again
- [ ] **Expected:** Goes directly to org dashboard
- [ ] Check database: `organization_setup_pending = false`

### Scenario 3: User Without Organization
- [ ] Login as org role user without organization
- [ ] **Expected:** Auto-redirect to `/setup-organization`
- [ ] Create organization
- [ ] **Expected:** Redirects to dashboard
- [ ] No redirect loops

### Scenario 4: Different User Roles
- [ ] **Individual:** Access org route → redirect to `/individual/dashboard`
- [ ] **Member:** Access org route → redirect to `/individual/my-organization`
- [ ] **Staff with org:** Access org route → dashboard loads
- [ ] **Super admin:** Appropriate access based on org

### Scenario 5: Direct URL Access
- [ ] Copy organization dashboard URL
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Login as org user
- [ ] Paste URL and navigate
- [ ] **Expected:** Loads directly, no loops

---

## Performance Checks

### Loading Speed
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds (normal connection)
- [ ] Loading spinner shows during load
- [ ] No blank screens or flashes
- [ ] Smooth transition from spinner to content

### Network Requests
- [ ] Open DevTools → Network tab
- [ ] Navigate to organization dashboard
- [ ] Verify: No duplicate API calls
- [ ] Verify: Profile fetched once
- [ ] Verify: Organization data fetched once
- [ ] No redundant queries

---

## Browser Console Verification

### Good Logs (Should See):
```
✅ [useUserRole] { userRole: 'organisation', organizationId: 'xxx', loading: false }
✅ [OrganisationRouteGuard] Access granted
✅ [SetupOrganization] Organization exists and setup complete, redirecting to dashboard
```

### Bad Logs (Should NOT See):
```
❌ [OrganisationRouteGuard] No organizationId, redirecting to setup (when org exists)
❌ Multiple rapid navigation logs
❌ Uncaught errors
❌ React rendering warnings
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Critical Issue Occurs:

1. **Revert Code:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Restore Database:**
   ```sql
   -- Restore from backup
   UPDATE profiles p
   SET organization_setup_pending = b.organization_setup_pending
   FROM backup_profiles_org_fix b
   WHERE p.id = b.id;
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback:**
   - [ ] Code reverted
   - [ ] Database restored
   - [ ] Application functioning
   - [ ] Users notified if needed

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 24 Hours:
- [ ] Monitor error logs every 2 hours
- [ ] Check Sentry/error tracking for new issues
- [ ] Monitor user feedback channels
- [ ] Check analytics for unusual patterns
- [ ] Verify no increase in bounce rate on org pages

### First Week:
- [ ] Daily error log review
- [ ] Review user support tickets
- [ ] Analyze dashboard load times
- [ ] Check for any edge cases
- [ ] Gather user feedback

## Emergency Contacts

**If issues arise:**

## Final Verification Command

Run this SQL to verify everything is correct:

```sql
-- Should return ONLY rows with status = '✅ CORRECT'
SELECT 
  p.email,
  p.user_role,
  p.organization_setup_pending,
  uo.organization_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN p.user_role IN ('organisation', 'staff') 
         AND p.organization_setup_pending = false 
         AND uo.organization_id IS NOT NULL THEN
      '✅ CORRECT: Has org, setup complete'
    WHEN p.user_role IN ('organisation', 'staff') 
         AND p.organization_setup_pending = true 
         AND uo.organization_id IS NULL THEN
      '✅ CORRECT: No org, setup pending'
    ELSE
      '🔴 ISSUE: Inconsistent state'
  END as status
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN user_organizations uo ON p.id = uo.user_id AND uo.status = 'active'
WHERE p.user_role IN ('organisation', 'staff')
ORDER BY status, p.created_at DESC;
```
