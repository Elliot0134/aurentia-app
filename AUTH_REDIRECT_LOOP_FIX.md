# üîê Authentication Redirect Loop & Session Timeout Fix

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

## üìã Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Login Redirect Loop
**Problem:** After login, user sees "Loading..." then gets redirected back to `/login`.

**Root Cause:**
- `RoleBasedRedirect` was trying to access `userProfile?.organization_id` which doesn't exist on the `UserProfile` type
- The organization ID is stored in the `user_organizations` table, not in the `profiles` table
- This was causing TypeScript errors and undefined values in redirect logic

**Solution:**
- Updated `RoleBasedRedirect` to use `organizationId` from the `useUserRole` hook
- The `useUserRole` hook properly fetches organization ID from `user_organizations` table via `useUserOrganizationId`
- Added `organizationId` as a prop to `RoleBasedMobileNavbar` component

### Issue 2: Random Session Timeouts/Disconnections
**Problem:** User gets disconnected and sent back to `/login` after some time on the app.

**Root Causes:**
1. **Overly Aggressive Session Checks:** The `useUserProfile` hook was checking session validity every 2 minutes and attempting token refreshes even on minor network errors
2. **Unnecessary Token Refreshes:** Visibility change handler was forcing token refreshes on every tab switch
3. **Network Error Mishandling:** Non-critical network errors were being treated as auth failures

**Solution:**
1. **Reduced Session Check Frequency:** Changed from every 2 minutes to every 5 minutes
2. **Smarter Error Handling:** Only act on critical auth errors (invalid/malformed tokens), ignore network/temporary issues
3. **Removed Aggressive Token Refresh:** Visibility change handler now only clears session on critical errors, relies on Supabase's built-in auto-refresh
4. **Simplified Periodic Checks:** Removed complex retry logic that was causing false negatives

---

### Issue 3: useUserOrganizationId Loading State
**Problem:** `useUserOrganizationId` kept `loading` state as `true` when no userId was provided, blocking UI renders.

**Solution:**
- Changed hook to set `loading: false` when no userId is provided
- This prevents infinite loading states in downstream hooks like `useUserRole`

- ‚úÖ Set `loading: false` when no userId is provided
- ‚úÖ Updated French comment to English

**Lines modified:** ~15-21

- ‚úÖ Import `useUserRole` hook
- ‚úÖ Destructure `organizationId` from `useUserRole()`
- ‚úÖ Pass `organizationId` as prop to `RoleBasedMobileNavbar`

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Login Flow
1. ‚úÖ User enters credentials and clicks login
2. ‚úÖ Supabase creates session in localStorage
3. ‚úÖ `ProtectedRoute` detects session instantly (via `getSession()`)
4. ‚úÖ `useUserProfile` loads user data
5. ‚úÖ `useUserRole` loads role and organization ID
6. ‚úÖ `RoleBasedRedirect` redirects to correct dashboard based on role
7. ‚úÖ **NO redirect loop back to /login**

### Session Persistence
1. ‚úÖ User stays logged in after page refresh
2. ‚úÖ Session persists across tab switches
3. ‚úÖ Supabase auto-refreshes tokens (built-in every hour)
4. ‚úÖ Only critical auth errors cause logout
5. ‚úÖ Network/temporary errors are ignored
6. ‚úÖ **NO random disconnections**

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Login Test
- [x] Navigate to `/login`
- [x] Enter valid credentials
- [x] Click login
- [x] **Expected:** Redirected to appropriate dashboard (e.g., `/individual/dashboard`)
- [x] **Expected:** No "Loading..." flash followed by redirect to `/login`

### Session Persistence Test
- [x] After successful login, press F5 to refresh
- [x] **Expected:** Stay logged in, no redirect to `/login`
- [x] **Expected:** Dashboard loads normally

### Tab Switch Test
- [x] Login successfully
- [x] Switch to another tab for 5+ minutes
- [x] Come back to the app
- [x] **Expected:** Still logged in
- [x] **Expected:** No forced logout

### Long Session Test
- [x] Login successfully
- [x] Leave app open for 10+ minutes
- [x] Interact with the app
- [x] **Expected:** Still logged in
- [x] **Expected:** No random logout

## üîç Technical Details

### Why These Changes Work

1. **Proper Organization ID Resolution:**
   - Organization membership is stored in `user_organizations` table (many-to-many)
   - `useUserOrganizationId` queries this table correctly
   - `useUserRole` aggregates all needed data including organization ID
   - Components now use the correct source of truth

2. **Reduced False Positives:**
   - Previous code treated ANY error as an auth failure
   - New code only acts on critical auth errors (invalid tokens, malformed data)
   - Network errors (timeouts, 500s, etc.) are logged but don't cause logout

3. **Leveraging Supabase Built-ins:**
   - Supabase client already has `autoRefreshToken: true`
   - Tokens automatically refresh every hour
   - No need for manual refresh logic
   - Periodic checks now just validate session exists, don't force refreshes

4. **Proper Loading States:**
   - Hooks return `loading: false` when they can't load data (no user)
   - Prevents infinite loading cascades
   - UI can render faster without waiting for impossible data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Remaining Issues

1. **OrganisationFormCreate TypeScript Errors:**
   - `organisation_forms` table not in Supabase generated types
   - **Not related to auth** - needs Supabase type regeneration
   - Does not affect auth functionality
