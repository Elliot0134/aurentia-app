# Clear Browser State - Fix Redirect Loop

## üßπ Step-by-Step: Clear ALL Browser State

The database is perfect, so the issue is likely **stale browser cache or localStorage**.

### Method 1: Hard Refresh (Try this first)

1. **Close ALL tabs** of your app
2. Open a **new tab**
3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete** (or Cmd + Shift + Delete on Mac)
4. Select:
   - ‚úÖ Cookies and other site data
   - ‚úÖ Cached images and files
   - ‚úÖ Time range: **All time**
5. Click **Clear data**
6. Navigate to your app URL
7. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R)

### Method 2: Clear localStorage Manually

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Expand **Local Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click on your app's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
5. Click **Clear All** button (or right-click ‚Üí Clear)
6. Refresh the page

### Method 3: Incognito/Private Window (Test)

1. Open an **Incognito/Private window**
2. Navigate to your app
3. Log in
4. Test if the redirect still happens

If it works in incognito ‚Üí **Browser cache is the problem!**

### Method 4: Nuclear Option (If above doesn't work)

```bash
# In your terminal
cd /home/matthieu/Desktop/Projects/aurentia-app

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Clear Vite/React cache
rm -rf .vite dist

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## üîç What to Check in DevTools

After clearing cache, check console logs:

### Expected (Good) Logs:
```
[SetupOrganization] useEffect triggered { loading: false, hasChecked: false }
[SetupOrganization] Organization exists and setup complete, redirecting...
[RoleBasedRedirect] Path is whitelisted, no redirect
‚úÖ Stays on /organisation/65fb9604.../dashboard
```

### Bad (Loop) Logs:
```
[SetupOrganization] redirecting to dashboard
[RoleBasedRedirect] redirecting to setup
[SetupOrganization] redirecting to dashboard  ‚Üê Repeat
[RoleBasedRedirect] redirecting to setup      ‚Üê Repeat
```

If you still see the loop after clearing cache, there's a code issue we need to fix.

## üìä Report Back

After trying Method 1 (Hard Refresh), tell me:

1. ‚úÖ Does it work now?
2. ‚ùå Still looping?
3. üîç What do the console logs show? (copy first 20 lines)

If still looping, we'll check the React code for timing issues.
