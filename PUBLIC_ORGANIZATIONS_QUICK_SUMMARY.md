# Public Organizations Discovery - Quick Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Address Field in Signup** âœ…
- Added address input field in signup form
- Stores user address in `profiles.address`
- Used for location-based organization discovery
- Updated signup logic to sync address to database

### 2. **Public Organizations Modal** âœ…
- Beautiful modal showing all public organizations
- Features:
  - Search by name, description, address, type
  - Proximity filter (50-200km slider) for users with address
  - Organization cards with logo, banner, name, description, address
  - "Postuler" button to apply
- Opens when clicking "Rejoindre une organisation" in sidebar

### 3. **Organization Applications System** âœ…
- New table: `organisation_applications`
- Tracks application status (pending, approved, rejected, cancelled)
- RLS policies for security
- Prevents duplicate applications
- Shows toast notifications

### 4. **Organization Setup Guide Modal** âœ…
- One-time modal for users with 'organisation' role but no organization
- Appears after first login post-email confirmation
- Guides user to create their organization
- Uses localStorage to show only once

## Key Files

### New Components
```
src/components/PublicOrganizationsModal.tsx
src/components/OrganizationSetupGuideModal.tsx
```

### Modified Components
```
src/pages/Signup.tsx (added address field)
src/components/RoleBasedSidebar.tsx (integrated modals)
src/types/userTypes.ts (added address to UserProfile)
```

### Database Migrations
```
db_migrations/20251007_add_address_and_org_applications.sql
db_migrations/20251007_update_sync_function_with_address.sql
```

## To Deploy

### 1. Run Database Migrations
Copy and execute the SQL from these files in Supabase SQL Editor:
1. `db_migrations/20251007_add_address_and_org_applications.sql`
2. `db_migrations/20251007_update_sync_function_with_address.sql`

### 2. Deploy Code
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting
```

## How It Works

### User Without Organization
1. Sign up with address
2. See "Rejoindre une organisation" button in sidebar
3. Click â†’ Modal opens with all public organizations
4. Browse/search/filter organizations
5. Click "Postuler" on desired organization
6. Application saved with status 'pending'
7. **Currently mocked** - No automatic join (toast only)

### Organization Role User (First Login)
1. Sign up selecting "Structure d'accompagnement"
2. Confirm email
3. Login â†’ Setup guide modal appears
4. Choose:
   - "CrÃ©er mon organisation" â†’ Go to onboarding
   - "Plus tard" â†’ Dismiss (won't show again)

## Current Behavior

âœ… **What Works:**
- Address field in signup
- Public organizations discovery modal
- Application creation (pending status)
- Toast notifications
- One-time setup guide for org users
- Prevent duplicate applications

ðŸ”„ **What's Mocked:**
- Application approval/rejection flow
- Actual joining of organization after apply

## Next Phase (Future)

To complete the feature, implement:
1. **Applications Dashboard** for organization admins
2. **Approve/Reject** buttons
3. **On approval:** Update user's `organization_id` and role to 'member'
4. **Notifications** to users about application status

## Testing

Test the following scenarios:
1. âœ… Signup with address field
2. âœ… "Rejoindre une organisation" button appears
3. âœ… Modal shows only public organizations
4. âœ… Search and filters work
5. âœ… Apply creates application record
6. âœ… Duplicate prevention works
7. âœ… Setup guide appears for org role users
8. âœ… Setup guide only shows once

## Important Notes

- Applications are tracked but **not automatically approved**
- Organizations must have `is_public = true` and `onboarding_completed = true` to appear
- Proximity filter is simplified (checks for address existence only)
- For production, integrate a geocoding API for real distance calculation
- The setup guide uses localStorage per user ID to track if seen

## Database Schema

### New Table: organisation_applications
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
- organization_id (uuid, foreign key to organizations)
- status (text: pending/approved/rejected/cancelled)
- message (text, optional)
- created_at, updated_at, reviewed_at
- reviewed_by (uuid, foreign key to profiles)
```

### Updated: profiles
```sql
+ address (text)
```
